# Efficient use of Coding Constructs

Efficient use of coding constructs can seem confusing at first. 

In your exam or the assignment, the SQA tend to be really clear i.e. ==they usually give you a really bad program that’s very inefficient.==

Efficiency is about using as few lines as possible. 

!!! example

    === "Inefficent"
    
        ``` python linenums="1"      
        print("Hello. My name is Bob.")
        print("Hello. My name is Bob.")
        print("Hello. My name is Bob.")
        print("Hello. My name is Bob.")
        print("Hello. My name is Bob.")
        ```
    
    === "Efficent"
    
        ``` python linenums="1"      
        for loop in range(0, 5):
            print("Hello. My name is Bob.")
        ```
The program on the left isn’t efficient. It says the same thing over and over again - something that could be done with a loop. 

The program on the right shows the same message, but it loops 5 times.

The program on the right does the same thing much more efficiently because it uses fewer lines of code to achieve the same goal. 

You’ll get much better at spotting these as you become experienced with Python.
