# Robustness

A robust program doesn’t crash when the user enters exceptional data. 

!!! example

    > A program is created to take the age of a person. 
    
    If the user enters a negative number (**no one has a negative age!**) the program shouldn’t just crash - it should show an error message and ask them to enter it again.
    

You can test robustness using exceptional test data i.e. ==how does the program behave if you enter exceptional data? If it crashes, the program isn’t robust.== 

If it can cope with errors (e.g. by asking them nicely to enter it again), it is robust, and you can say this in your evaluation.
