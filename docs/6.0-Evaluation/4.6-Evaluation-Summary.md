# Evaluation Summary

Make sure that you can evaluate your program in the four areas - fitness for purpose, robustness, readability and efficiency of coding constructs. You’ll normally be given the names, but you have to recall what they mean.

For example, the coursework assignment usually contains a section laid out like this:

Evaluate your program in terms of:

`Fitness for purpose (1 mark)` - My program is fit for purpose because .......

`Robustness (1 mark)` - My program is not robust, because if the user enters a string instead of a number the program crashes (an execution error).

==**Readability (2 marks)**== - My program is readable because I used meaningful variable names like “score” instead of just calling it num1, num2, etc.  However, I could have made it more readable if I had used internal commentary.

You are expected to make points in each box - this can be a good way to gain marks in the programming part of the assignment, so long as you prepare! 

==Be honest - you get more marks for constructive criticism than saying the program does something, when it doesn’t.==
