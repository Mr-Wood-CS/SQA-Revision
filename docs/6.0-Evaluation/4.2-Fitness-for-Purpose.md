# Fitness for Purpose

If your program is fit for purpose, it means it does what it’s supposed to do. 

If the program meets all of the functional requirements you set out in the analysis, then it is fit for purpose - it does all the things it’s supposed to. 

If it doesn’t meet one or more, it must not be fit for purpose.

When you are doing the evaluation, use the term ==‘fit for purpose’== or ==‘not fit for purpose’== - be explicit. 

Say why it is or isn’t fit for purpose, mentioning the specific requirement e.g.:

* The program is fit for purpose, because it asks the user their age, and shows an error if they enter a negative number
  
* The program is not fit for purpose, as it is only supposed to accept percentages between 0 and 100, but it accepts values outside this range
  
Try to link your answer to exactly which requirement it is. 

Make sure that your answer links to the program you’re being asked about - don’t say ==“it doesn’t meet the requirement”==, because that could apply to any program. 

**Which requirements are specific to this program?**

!!! info "Exam Tip"
    
    The SQA will sometimes give you programs they’ve written, and ask if they are fit for purpose. 
    
    ==Don’t be too kind!== 
    
    If it isn’t fit for purpose, say so. 
    
    If you try to be polite, and say it’s err… sorta fit for purpose, when it’s not, you won’t get the mark. Be honest!
