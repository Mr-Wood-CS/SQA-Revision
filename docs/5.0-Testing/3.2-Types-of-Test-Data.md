# Types of Test Data

When we test a program, we use test data. You enter the test data as the inputs to the program. The data should try to capture a range of different scenarios - don’t just test the program with one piece of data.

As an example:

You are asked to write a program that picks a random number. The user has to guess what number the program has picked. They are asked to enter a number between 0 and 10. If they enter a number outside that range, the program should show an error message.

There are three types of data you need to be able to use and give examples of: normal, extreme and exceptional. In this example, the program expects a number between 0 and 10 (inclusive).

<table class = "testing">
    <tr>
        <th>Normal</th>
        <td>Normal test data is data that is definitely within the expected range. In this case, we could choose 5 (for example), or 2. Both of those are clearly between 0 and 10.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Extreme</th>
        <td>Extreme test data is on the edges of what’s acceptable. In this case, 0 or 10. They should still be accepted by the program - they’re just within range.</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Exceptional</th>
        <td>Exceptional test data is clearly and definitely invalid/wrong. For example, in this case, -50 or 10000. Those should definitely be rejected by the program.</td>
    </tr>
</table>
