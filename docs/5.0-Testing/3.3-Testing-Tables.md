# Testing Tables

The test table shows the data we test the program with. 

We put one example in each row of the table (i.e. don’t say “anything between 1 and 9” - pick one!)

<table class = "testing">
    <tr>
        <th>Test Data</th>
        <th>Type of Testing</th>
        <th>Expected Result</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>0</td>
        <td>Normal</td>
        <td>Should be accepted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>5</td>
        <td>Extreme</td>
        <td>Should be accepted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>-50000</td>
        <td>Exceptional</td>
        <td>Should be rejected</td>
    </tr>
</table>

In the test table, you should say what you expect the program to do. Some test tables have another column for what actually happened, and you would record this afterwards.

Take another example - rolling a dice. 

You are asked for four pieces of test data: one normal, two extreme and one exceptional. 

Remember that normal data is definitely within range, extreme is on the edge, but accepted, and exceptional is definitely incorrect. 

Which values would be valid for a standard 6-sided dice?

<table class = "testing">
    <tr>
        <th>Test Data</th>
        <th>Type of Testing</th>
        <th>Expected Result</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>3</td>
        <td>Normal</td>
        <td>Should be accepted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>1</td>
        <td>Extreme</td>
        <td>Should be accepted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>6</td>
        <td>Extreme</td>
        <td>Should be accepted</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>180</td>
        <td>Exceptional</td>
        <td>Should be rejected</td>
    </tr>
</table>

Here, the values 1 and 6 are the minimum and maximum the dice can roll, so they are extreme. They should still be accepted by the program - it’s perfectly valid for a dice to roll 6. However, the dice can’t roll 180, so that is clearly a piece of exceptional test data, because it’s invalid.

You could be asked to give examples of different types of test data, and sometimes to complete the test table.

In the coursework assignment, you’ll usually be given specific data to test your program with. For example, you might be asked to write a program that averages five numbers. Here, you would have to use the test data that you’re given to test your program.

Sometimes, you could be asked to state what the differences are between the three types of test data.
