# Traversing an Array

We know that arrays are used for storing a list of data.

The key benfit of arrays is that they reduce repetition. For example:

``` python title="Without an Array" linenums="1"
var_1 = 1
var_2 = 2
var_3 = 3
var_4 = 4
var_5 = 5
```

```python title="With an Array" linenums="1"
var_numbers = [1,2,3,4,5]
```

We also know that loops are used to reduce repetition in our lines of code. For example: 

We can use a loop to traverse the array - that means, to travel through it, or loop through it.

Traversing an array is one of the standard algorithms.

``` python title="Without a Loop" linenums="1"
print (1)
print (2)
print (3)
print (4)
print (5)
```
``` python title="With a Loop" linenums="1"
for i in range(1,6):
    print (i)
```

!!! info "The Steps to This Algorithm are:"

    ```pseudocode

    1.0 - Start a for loop, for the number of elements in the array
            2.0 - Use the array element[counter]
    3.0 - End for loop
    ```

## Using a Loop to Traverse an Array

In programming we use loops to traverse the elements of an array. 

Example: 

!!! example "The Snow White Program"

    === "Code"

        ``` python linenums="1"
        names = [“Dopey”, “Grumpy”, “Doc”, “Bashful”, “Sneezy”, “Sleepy”, “Happy”]
        
        for counter in range(0, 7):
            print(names[counter])
        ```

    === "Explanation"

        `Line 1`

        Initialise the names list to hold 7 names.

        `Line 2`

        Start a loop that from 0 to 6 and print the name

        `Line 4`

        On each `iteration of the loop` output the data that is held within that element of the array.

!!! tip "Remember"

    Remember that the word counter is just a variable name. 
    
    It could be anything:

    ``` python  hl_lines="3 4" linenums="1"

    names = [“Dopey”, “Grumpy”, “Doc”, “Bashful”, “Sneezy”, “Sleepy”, “Happy”]
        
    for bannanas in range(0, 7):
        print(names[bannanas])
    ```
