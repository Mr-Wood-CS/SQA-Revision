# Running Total Within a Loop

!!! tip "Quick Links"

    * [Running total from User Input](#running-total-from-user-input)
    * [Running Total from an Array](#running-total-from-an-array)
    * [Running Total within a Conditional Loop](#running-total-within-a-conditional-loop)


The running total in a loop algorithm (or running total) is used to keep a running total of some numbers.

These numbers can be either:

* Values entered by the user

* A list of values in an array

In addition, a running total will typically use a fixed loop. 

!!! info "Running Total Algorithm"

    ```pseudocode

    1.0 - Set total to 0

    2.0 - Start a for loop (with a loop counter)
            3.0 - Add current item to the total or increase total by 1 depending on the program.
    4.0 - End for loop
    ```

## Running total from User Input

In this example, the user is asked to enter ten numbers. 

As each number is entered, it is added to the total. 

The programmer might then choose to display this total at the end:

!!! info "Pseudocode Example:"

    ```pseudocode

    1.0 - Set total to 0

    2.0 - For counter from 0 to 9
            3.0 - Get number from user
            4.0 - Set total to total + number
    5.0 - End for loop
    ```

!!! example "Running Total From User Input"

    === "Code"

        ``` Python linenums="1"
        total = 0

        for counter in range(0, 10):
            num = (int(input("Enter number"))
            total = total + num         
        ```

    === "Explanation"

        `Line 1`

        Create a variable called total and set it to 0.
        
        `Line 3`

        This line starts a loop that will run 10 times.

        The for loop also creates ==another variable== called `counter` which counts from `0 to 9` (==10 numbers in total==).

        `Line 4`

        Ask the user to input a number.
        
        `Line 5` 

        Update the total by adding the number you just entered (num) to whatever is already in total.

        For example: If total is `5` and you enter `3`, the new total becomes `5 + 3 = 8`.

## Running Total from an Array

Below is an array of five daily temperatures:

<figure markdown="span">
    ![List Example](Images/List.png){ width="400" }
</figure>

The name of the array is `temps[]`

We want to add up a total of all these temperatures. 

The algorithm reads one value at a time from the array, and adds it to the current total variable.

!!! info "The Steps to This Algorithm are:"

    ```pseudocode

    1.0 - Add values to the array 
    2.0 - Set total to 0

    3.0 - Start a for loop (with a loop counter)
            4.0 - Add current item from the array to the total
    5.0 - End for loop

    6.0 - Display total
    ```

!!! example "Running Total From an Array"

    === "Code"

        ``` Python linenums="1"
        temps =  [18.2, 19.1, 20.1, 19.8, 21.4]
        total = 0.0

        for counter in range(len(temps)):
            total = total + temps[counter]

        print (total)
        ```

    === "Explanation"

        `Line 1`

        Creates a list called temps that contains five temperature values (in degrees). 
        
        Each number in the list represents a temperature reading.

        `Line 2`

        Initialises a variable called total to 0.0. 
        
        It will be used to store the sum of all the temperatures in the list.

        `Line 4`

        Starts a for loop that goes through each index of the `temps` list.

        * len(temps) gives the length of the list, which is 5 in this case.
        
        * range(len(temps)) creates a sequence of numbers from 0 to 4 (the indices of the list).
        
        * The variable counter will take each of these values (0, 1, 2, 3, and 4) one by one during the loop.

        `Line 5` 

        Inside the loop, the program adds the temperature at the current index (temps[counter]) to the total. For example:
        
        * On the first iteration (counter = 0), it adds temps[0] (18.2) to total.

        * On the second iteration (counter = 1), it adds temps[1] (19.1) to total.

        * This continues for all the temperatures in the list.

        `Line 7` 

        After the loop finishes (all temperatures have been added to total), the program outputs the total sum of the temperatures.

## Running Total within a Conditional Loop

Very rarely, you might be asked to use a running total with a conditional loop (while). 

A question like this was used in the 2019 exam (Q19b). 

he only change is that you use a while / conditional loop instead of a fixed loop.

This example asks the user to keep entering numbers, until the overall total reaches 100 or more.

!!! info "The Steps to This Algorithm are:"

    ```pseudocode

    1.0 - Set total to 0

    2.0 - While total is less than 100
            3.0 - Ask user to input a number
            4.0 - Set total to total + number
    5.0 - End for loop
    ```

!!! example "Running Total within a Conditional Loop"

    === "Code"

        ``` Python linenums="1"
        total = 0

        while total < 100:
            num = (int(input("Enter number"))
            total = total + num
        ```

    === "Explanation"

        `Line 1`

        Create a variable called `total` and set it to 0.

        `Line 3`

        Start a loop that will run whilst `total` is less than 100.

        `Line 4`

        Ask the user to input a number.

        `Line 5` 

        Update the total by adding the number you just entered (num) to total.
