## Random

Something that is random is open to chance - like rolling dice, or tossing a coin.

Before we use a random number, we have to put this line at the top of the program:

!!! example

	```python linenums="1"
		# This program is going to use random numbers
		import random
	```

Random will always returns an integer (a whole number) and will only generate a random number that is between two parameters:

!!! example

	```python linenums="1"
		# Generate a random number from 1 to 6
		dice = random.randint(1, 6)
	```

The code above will generate a number that could be either 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 or 6.

Complete example:

!!! example "The Random Number Game"

	```python linenums="1"
	
		# Add the random module
		import random
		
		# Ask the user to enter a number
		guess = int(input("What is your guess?"))
		
		target = random.randint(1, 10)
  
		if guess == target:
			print("Well done, you guessed correctly.")
		else:
			print("Sorry, you guessed wrongly")
	```
## Length 

The length function, shortened to len() returns the length - the number of characters - in a string.

__For example, len(“hello”) is 5, and len(“abc”) is 3:__

This example calculates the length of a word, stores it in a variable called “how_long”, and displays it on the screen.

!!! example

	```python linenums="1"
	
		# Stores and displays how many characters are in the word “hello”
		how_long = len("hello")
  
		print(how_long)

	```

You could also use len() to ask the user to enter a password, and tell them whether their password is long enough:
    
!!! example

	```python linenums="1"
	
		# Ask the user to enter their password
		passwd = input("Please enter your password")
		
		# The password must be at least 6 characters long
		if len(passwd) > 6:
		    print("Your password is long enough")
		else:
		    print("Your password is NOT long enough")

	```    

__This problem could be refined further by using a loop and asking the user to keep entering their password until it is valid.__

## Round

Using a round function, we can round a real number either:

* To the nearest whole number
  
* To a certain number of decimal places.
  
To round to the nearest whole number (integer):

!!! example "This code would display the number 3."

	```python linenums="1"
	
		num1 = round(3.14159265)
  
		print(num1)

	```   

To round to 2 decimal places:

!!! example "This code would print 3.14."

	```python linenums="1"
	
		num2 = round(3.14159265, 2)
		
		print(num2)

	```   
 
We could round to any number of decimal places by adding it as a parameter in brackets:

!!! example "This code would round to 5 decimal places (3.14159)."

	```python linenums="1"
	
		num3 = round(3.14159265, 5)
		
		print(num3)

	```
