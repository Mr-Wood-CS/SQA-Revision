# Complex Conditional Statements (AND, OR and NOT)

## AND, OR, NOT

Sometimes conditions can be more complicated. The logical operators and, or and not can be added to make complex conditions.

Suppose we ask for a percentage, but it must be between 0 and 100. This could also be written as greater than or equal to 0, and less than or equal to 100.

* The number 53 meets this condition, because it is >= 0, and it is <= 100
* Although the number 110 is >= 0, it is not <= 100, so the condition is not true
* -273 is less than or equal to 100, but it is not >= 0, so the condition is not true
