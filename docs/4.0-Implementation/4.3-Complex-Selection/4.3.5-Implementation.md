# Implementation

**AND**

:   __Check if two conditions are both true__

	!!! example
	
		```python linenums="1"
	  		if age >= 17 and age <= 100:
	   			print(“You are between 17 and 100”)
		```

**OR**

:   __Check if at least one (or both) of the conditions is true.__

	!!! example
	
		```python linenums="1"
			if weather == “rain” or weather == “cloudy”
				print(“It is not nice weather today”)
		```

**NOT**

:   __Check if a condition is not true.__

	!!! example
	
		```Python
			if not age < 17
				print(“You are not less than 17”)
				print(“So you must be at least 17 or over”)
		```

🔑 __Key Point__ Syntax Matters

:	You __MUST__ always write the full condition out each time.

	!!! warning "You can’t write:"

		```python
			if weather == “rain” or “cloudy”
		```

	!!! correct "You must write:"

		```python
			if weather == “rain” or weather == “cloudy”
		```
