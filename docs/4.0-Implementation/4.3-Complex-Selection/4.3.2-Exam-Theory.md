# Exam Theory

For your exam at the end of the year and your prelim exams in January you will be expected to read, undertand and use ==Exam Reference Language==
 As we work through through each topic you will be introduced to new ==Exam Reference Language==.

For this topic we will learnng: 

* Output

* Assignment

* Variable Data Types

* Input

* Artihmatic Operators


**Output**

```pseudocode

SEND.......TO DISPLAY

```

**Assignment**

```pseudocode

DECLARE.......AS......INITIALLY......

```

!!! warning "Note"

    Before using a variable you **MUST ALWAYS** ==assign== the variable first.

**Adding a Value to a Variable**

```pseudocode

DECLARE.......AS......INITIALLY......

SET.......TO.......

```

**Inputting a Value (from a user) to a Variable**

```pseudocode

DECLARE.......AS......INITIALLY......

RECIEVE.......FROM KEYBOARD

```
   
**Arithmatic Operators**

There are several ways that you can use Arithmatic operators but I will show you the two main ways to use them.

**Option 1 - Using Variables**

```pseudocode

DECLARE num1 AS int INITIALLY 2
DECLARE num2 AS int INITIALLY 2

DECLARE total AS int INITIALLY 0

SET total TO num1 + num2

SEND total TO DISPLAY

```

**Option 2 - Display the Result in an Output**

```pseudocode

DECLARE num1 AS int INITIALLY 2
DECLARE num2 AS int INITIALLY 2

SEND num1 + num2 TO DISPLAY

```
