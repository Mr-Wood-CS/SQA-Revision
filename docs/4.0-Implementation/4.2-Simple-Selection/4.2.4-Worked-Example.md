# Worked Example

## Analysis

You have been asked to create a program that will:

1. Ask the user to enter their age  
2. Decide if they should pay a **child price**, **teen price**, or **adult price**  
3. Display the correct price based on their age

<table class="testing">
    <tr>
        <th>Input</th>
        <th>Process</th>
        <th>Output</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Age</td>
        <td>Decide ticket price based on age</td>
        <td>Ticket price</td>
    </tr>
</table>

    **Main Steps**

    : 1 - Input age  
    : 2 - Decide price using selection  
    : 3 - Display price  

    **Refinements**

    : 2.1 - If age < 13 then set price to "£5 (Child price)"
    : 2.2 - Elif age < 18 then set price to "£7 (Teen price)"
    : 2.3 - Else set price to "£10 (Adult price)"

## Implementation

```python title="Ticket Price Program" linenums="1"
price = ""

age = int(input("Enter your age: "))

if age < 13:
    price = "£5 (Child price)"
elif age < 18:
    price = "£7 (Teen price)"
else:
    price = "£10 (Adult price)"

print(price)
```
