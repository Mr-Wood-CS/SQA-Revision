# Explanation

In National 5, you will often be asked to follow a design that has these decisions. 

==**You will implement the decisions in Python with if statements and conditional operators**==.

**Conditional Operators**

<center>

| Symbols     | Description                                                         |
| ----------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `==`        | ==Equal to==, e.g. 5 == 5, score == 12 or Subject == "Computing".   |
| `<`         | ==Less than==, e.g. 40 and 62 are both < 99                         |
| `>`         | ==Greater than==, e.g. 50.4 and 85.1 are both > 10.8                |
| `<=`        | ==Less than or equal to==, e.g. 22 and 70 are both <= 70            |
| `>=`        | ==Greater than or equal to==, e.g. 100 and 105 are both >= 100      |

**If Statements**

The if statement always starts with the word ==if==, followed by a statement - a conditional operator - and another statement.

For example:

* **If** <span class="mark-red"><abbr title="Statement One">**weather**</abbr></span> is <span class="mark-green"><abbr title="Conditional Operator">**equal to**</abbr></span> <span class="mark-red"><abbr title="Statement Two">**rain**</abbr></span> display '**Wear a coat**'

!!! example 

	```Python linenums="1"

		password = input("Please enter the password")
		
		if password == “hello123”:
			print("Access granted")
	```

**If/Else Statements**

Sometimes, we want the program to do something if data meets a condition, or otherwise, it is to do something else. 

For example:

* **If** <span class="mark-red"><abbr title="Statement One">**weather**</abbr></span> is <span class="mark-green"><abbr title="Conditional Operator">**equal to**</abbr></span> <span class="mark-red"><abbr title="Statement Two">**rain**</abbr></span> display '**Wear a coat**'

* **Else** display '**You don't need a coat**'

!!! example

	```Python
		age = int(input("Please enter your age"))
		
		if age >= 17:
			print("You ae old enough to drive.")
		else:
			print("Sorry, you are not old enough to drive.”)
	```



**If/Elif/Else Statements**

Sometimes, information comes in multiple categories.

For example; we could ask for a test mark percentage:

* **If** <span class="mark-red"><abbr title="Statement One">**mark**</abbr></span> is <span class="mark-green"><abbr title="Conditional Operator">**greater than (or equal to)**</abbr></span> <span class="mark-red"><abbr title="Statement Two">**70**</abbr></span> display '**Student gets an A**'

* **Else If** <span class="mark-red"><abbr title="Statement One">**mark**</abbr></span> is <span class="mark-green"><abbr title="Conditional Operator">**greater than (or equal to)**</abbr></span> <span class="mark-red"><abbr title="Statement Two">**60**</abbr></span> display '**Student gets an B**'

* **Else If** <span class="mark-red"><abbr title="Statement One">**mark**</abbr></span> is <span class="mark-green"><abbr title="Conditional Operator">**greater than (or equal to)**</abbr></span> <span class="mark-red"><abbr title="Statement Two">**50**</abbr></span> display '**Student gets a C**'

* **Else** display '**No award**'.

!!! example

	```Python linenums="1"
		
		mark = int(input("Please enter percentage mark"))

		if mark >= 70:
			grade = “A”
		elif mark >= 60:
			grade = “B”
		elif mark >= 50:
			grade = “C”
		else:
			grade = “F”

		print(grade)
	```

!!! warning "Key Points"

    1. The code that follows an If/Elif/Else statement is indented (tabbed in). This is only triggered if the condition is true.

    2. An If/Elif/Else statement always ends with a colon :
