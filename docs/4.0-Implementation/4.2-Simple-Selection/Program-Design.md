# Program Design

Before writing code, programmers will design what the program will do.  

This helps them plan **inputs**, **processes**, and **outputs** before they start coding.

==For all examples on this page we will use the following scenario:==

You have been asked to create a `Calculate Total` program that will ask a user to:

1. Input two numbers
2. Calculate total 
3. Display the total

        For Variables and Assignment we only need the following symbol.

        <figure markdown="span">

    When creating **Structure Diagram** you **MUST** follow the following rules:

    : 1- We start with the main task/problem, and put this in the top box.

    : 2- We can break the structure diagram into roughly three parts: the __inputs__, the __process__ and the __outputs__.

    : 3- ==**These have to be done in order from left to right**==

    : 4- All lines must not have an arrow

    When creating **Flowcharts** you **MUST** follow the following rules:

    : 1- All Flowcharts start with a ==Start== and end with an ==End== 

    : 2- The flow of the diagram always goes ==Top to Bottom==

    : 4- All lines must have an arrow
