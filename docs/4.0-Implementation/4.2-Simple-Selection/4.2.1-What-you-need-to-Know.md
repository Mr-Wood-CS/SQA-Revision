    <span class="mark-green"><strong>I can</strong></span> identify the purpose and functional requirements of a problem that relates to the design and implementation at this level, in terms of:

    * inputs
    * processes
    * outputs

    <span class="mark-green"><strong>I can</strong></span> describe and implement the appropriate constructs in a high-level (textual) language: selection constructs using simple conditional statements with <, >, <=, >=, ==, != operators

    <span class="mark-green"><strong>I can</strong></span> identify the data types, structures, and design techniques needed to solve a problem at this level, and be able to demonstrate and implement one of these techniques to create efficient solutions:

    - Structure diagrams
    - Flowcharts
    - Pseudocode
