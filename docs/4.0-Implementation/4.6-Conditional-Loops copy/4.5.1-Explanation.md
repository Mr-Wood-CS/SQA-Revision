# Variables and Assignment

!!! info "What you Need to Know"

**Output**

In computer programs, output is the way a program communicates information to the user, usually by displaying text or results on the screen. 

It allows users to see what the program is doing, such as showing messages, displaying answers, or confirming that data has been processed. 

Without output, a program would appear to do nothing, even if it was working correctly in the background. Clear and meaningful output helps make a program easier to understand and use.

**Variables**

Variables are used to store information that the program can use and change as it runs. 

==This process is called **assignment**, as the program assigns a specific value and a name to a variable for later use.==

: **Variable Naming Rules**

: - A variable name must start with a letter or the underscore character
- A variable name cannot start with a number
- A variable name can only contain alpha-numeric characters and underscores (A-z, 0-9, and _ )
- Variable names are case-sensitive (age, Age and AGE are three different variables)
- A variable name cannot be any of the **Python keywords**.

: and although this one is not a rule....

: - It is important to use **meaningful**/**sensible** variable names. 

In addition, each variable also has a data type, which defines the kind of data it holds. 

For example, an integer stores whole numbers, a real number stores decimals, a string stores text, and a Boolean stores either true or false. 

Assigning values to variables gives the program something to work with 

: — **for example, storing a person’s age, a price, or a message**.

==At National 5 there are five data types that you must know:==

| Data Type   |Description                                  |
| :---------: |:-------------------------------------------:|
| Integer     | Whole number: 12, -50,100                   |
| Real | With a decimal point: 22.5, 0001            |
| String      | Words and symbols: hello, abc123            |
| Character   | A single letter, digit or symbol: a, Z, $, #|
| Boolean     | True (1) or False (0)                       |

**Working with Numbers**

When working with numbers, programs can carry out mathematical operations such as addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division to solve problems or process data. 

When dealing with strings, the program can join pieces of text together using concatenation — for example, combining a user’s name with a greeting to form a full sentence. 

Understanding how to assign, manipulate, and output both numbers and strings is essential in programming, as it allows the creation of interactive and meaningful programs that respond to user input.

| :---------: |:-------------------------------------------:|
| +           | Addition                                    |
| -           | Subtraction                                 |
| /           | Division                                    |
| **          | Raise to a power                            |
