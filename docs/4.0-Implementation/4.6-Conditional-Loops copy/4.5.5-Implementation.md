**Output**

: Output shows information to the user. It lets the program display text, numbers, or results so the user knows what’s happening.

: In Python we do this using the **print()** statement, putting the message we want to display in the brackets with speech marks if its a word or character.

    !!! example
        ```Python
        print("Hello world")
        ```

**Assignment**

: Assignment gives a value to a variable. It tells the computer to store a piece of data under a specific name for later use.

    !!! example "Example"

        ``` python title="Variables" linenums="1"
        name1 = ("Alice")
        name2 = ("Ben")
        name3 = ("Carla")
        name4 = ("David")
        name5 = ("Eilidh")
        ```

: In addition, each variable also has a data type, which defines the kind of data it holds. 

: Each of these variables stores data of a different type.

    !!! example "Example"

        ``` python title="Data Types" linenums="1"
        num1 = int(1)
        num2 = float(2.0)
        word = str("Hello")
        character = chr("@")
        trueOrFalse = bool(False)
        ```



    !!! warning "Key Information"

        * Even though it holds only one value, the SQA considers a __variable__ to be a __data structure__, because it is a named place in memory where data is stored.

        * Unless otherwise told a program will always treat your variable as a string.
    

**Input**

??? info "Input"

    :   Input allows users to interact with the program by adding data. 

    :   The program then uses this data to make decisions or display results.

        !!! example "Example"

            ``` python title="Inputting Strings" linenums="1"
            name1 = input("Enter name 1: ")
            name2 = input("Enter number 1: ")

            print(name1)
            print(name2)
            ```

            ``` python title="Inputting Integers" linenums="1"
            num1 = int(input("Enter number 1: "))
            num2 = int(input("Enter number 2: "))

            print(num1)
            print(num2)
            ```

??? info "String Concatenation"

    String concatenation is the term used when ==joining two string variables== or a ==string== and a ==string variable==.

    !!! example
        ```Python
        word1 = "Hello"
        word2 = "World"

        sentence = word1 + word2
        ```

    !!! tip

        The example above doesn’t include a space, you would have to add a space to the end of **"Hello"** or the beginning of **"World"**. 

    Concatenation is often used to make sentences more readable in output.

    If you want to print a **string** and a **variable**, use a comma between the strings:

    !!! example
        ```Python
        yearOfStudy = int(input("What year are you in? "))

        print("Welcome to", yearOfStudy)
        ```


??? info "Working with Numbers"

    Python programs will often carry out calculations with operators. The result is usually stored in a variable:

    Addition adds values, subtraction removes, division splits one number by another, multiplication repeats a value, and powers raise one number to another.

    !!! example

        ```Python
        num1 = 5
        num2 = 7
        sum = num1 + num2
        ```

    You can use the following operators:

    !!! example
        ```Python
        # Three variables
        num1 = 5
        num2 = 7
        sum = 0.0

        # Addition
        sum = num1 + num2

        # Subtraction
        sum = num1 - num2

        # Division
        sum = num1 / num2

        # Multiplication
        sum = num1 * num2

        # Raise to a power
        sum = num1 ** num2

        # To square or cube a number, you would say:
        square = num1 ** 2
        cube = num1 ** 3
        ```
