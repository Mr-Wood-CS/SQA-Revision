    <span class="mark-green"><strong>I can</strong></span> identify the purpose and functional requirements of a problem that relates to the design and implementation at this level, in terms of:

    * inputs
    * processes
    * outputs

    <span class="mark-green"><strong>I can</strong></span> describe, demonstrate, and implement the following data types, structures, and constructs appropriately in a high-level (textual) language:

    - **Data types and structures**:

        - Character
        - String
        - Numeric (integer and real)
        - Boolean
        - 1-D arrays

    - **Programming constructs**:

        - Expressions to assign values
        - Expressions to return values using arithmetic operations (addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation)
        - Expressions to concatenate strings

    <span class="mark-green"><strong>I can</strong></span> identify the data types, structures, and design techniques needed to solve a problem at this level, and be able to demonstrate and implement one of these techniques to create efficient solutions:

    - Structure diagrams
    - Flowcharts
    - Pseudocode
