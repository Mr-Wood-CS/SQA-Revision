The __Software Development Lifecycle__ is generally an iterative process that consists of six stages:

* Analysis - to fully understand the problem and what the program must do
* Design - to plan how the program will work before building it
* Implementation - to write the actual code
* Testing - to check that the program works correctly and meets the requirements
* Documentation - to produce materials that help users and future developers understand and use the software.
* Evaluation - to judge how successful the software is
