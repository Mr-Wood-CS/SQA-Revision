## What is a Software Development Methodology?

To answer this, we will split the question into two parts, Software and Development Methodology.

As you already know, all computer systems are made up of hardware and software.

The term hardware is easy to understand, because you can touch it. For example, the processor, RAM, network adaptor and graphic cards etc...

==Software, however, is not so obvious………………==

Software is all the programs, instructions and data that allow the hardware to do something useful and interesting. Some of the most used include; word, excel, PowerPoint & Google (other browsers are available!)
