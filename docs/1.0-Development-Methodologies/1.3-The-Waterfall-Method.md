The __Waterfall Method__ is classified as a linear development process, as the developer or development team works through each stage sequentially with little to no involvement from the client until the final product is delivered.

Although it is classified as a linear development process, in practice it is often necessary to revisit earlier stages. For example, if an issue is discovered during testing, the team may need to go back and revise the design, reimplement it, and test it again.
