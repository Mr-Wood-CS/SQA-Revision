## Programming Constructs – Revision Guide

### What are programming constructs?
Programming constructs are the basic parts used to build programs.  
They control the order, decisions, repetition, and data in a program.

---

## Programming Constructs

### Sequence
**Definition:**  
Instructions are executed in order, one after another.

**Key idea:**  
The program runs from top to bottom.

---

### Selection
**Definition:**  
A programming construct that allows a program to make decisions.

**Key idea:**  
The program checks a condition and chooses what to do next.  
Uses `IF`, `ELSE`, `ELSE IF`.

---

### Iteration
**Definition:**  
A programming construct that allows instructions to be repeated.

**Key idea:**  
The program repeats steps using loops.  
Uses `FOR`, `WHILE`, `REPEAT UNTIL`.

---

### Variables
**Definition:**  
A named memory location used to store data.

**Key idea:**  
Stores one value that can change while the program runs.

---

### Arrays
**Definition:**  
A data structure used to store multiple values of the same data type.

**Key idea:**  
Stores a list of values under one name.  
Each value is accessed using an index.

---

### Input
**Definition:**  
Data entered into a program.

**Examples:**  
Keyboard, file, sensor.

---

### Output
**Definition:**  
Information produced by a program.

**Examples:**  
Screen, sound, file.

---

## Exam Tip
If a question asks about **programming constructs**, you should mention:

- Sequence  
- Selection  
- Iteration  
- Variables  
- Arrays  
- Input  
- Output

## Model Exam Answers

### 1 Mark
**Q:** What is selection?  
**A:** Selection allows a program to make a decision based on a condition.

---

### 2 Marks
**Q:** Describe iteration.  
**A:** Iteration is a programming construct that allows instructions to be repeated.  
It is used when the same task needs to run more than once.

---

### 3 Marks
**Q:** Name and describe three programming constructs.  
**A:**  
- **Sequence** – instructions are executed in order.  
- **Selection** – the program makes decisions using conditions.  
- **Iteration** – instructions are repeated using loops.
