    __You must be able to__:

    Identify the data types and structures required for a problem that relates to the implementation at this level, as listed below.
    
    Describe, identify, and be able to read and understand:
    
    : * structure diagrams
            
    : * flowcharts
            
    : * pseudocode
    
    Exemplify and implement one of the above design techniques to design efficient solutions to a problem.
    
    Describe, and implement user-interface design, in terms of input and output, using a wireframe.

Efficient problem-solving in computing begins with careful planning and the use of appropriate design techniques to ensure solutions are both effective and easy to implement. 

A key aspect of this process involves identifying the data types and structures required to solve a problem. These choices are critical, as they influence how efficiently a program can handle inputs, process data, and deliver outputs.

To design and understand solutions, several tools and techniques are used:

* Structure diagrams provide a visual breakdown of a system, showing its components and how they interact.

* Flowcharts illustrate the logical flow of processes, making it easier to follow the sequence of steps within an algorithm.
  
* Pseudocode bridges the gap between natural language and programming by offering a simplified, language-agnostic way to represent a solution.

In addition, user-interface design (__wireframes__) are another essential element that usees simple sketches or digital drafts that outline the layout of a user interface, detailing how input and output are managed.
